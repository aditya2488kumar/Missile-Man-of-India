            Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam (1931–2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and the 11th President of
            India (2002–2007). Born in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he studied physics and aerospace engineering and became a
            key figure in India's space and missile programs, earning the title "Missile Man of India." He played a
            crucial role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998. Elected president with bipartisan support, he was
            known as the "People's President." After his presidency, he focused on education and writing. Kalam passed
            away in 2015 while delivering a lecture, and was honored with a state funeral in his hometown.
